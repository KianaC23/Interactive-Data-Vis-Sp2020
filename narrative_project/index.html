        For this project I initially wanted to look at diversity among directors of the most popular films of the last ten years. 
        Most articles pointed to the same study by the Annenberg Foundation at USC that puts out an annual report on diversity
        among the major film studios. They touch on many factors surrounding the disparity between women, undersrepesented groups and
        their white male counterparts. This includes hiring practices, which genre directors get to film and much more. The study started in 2007 so I made a dataset using the top 100 grossing films (domestic) 
        from 2007 -2019 using their study as a touchstone. My numbers are not exactly the same as they publish before the final totals
        for each year are reported. Overall Hollywood has alot of work to do. For my project I focused on women, specifically women of color.
        In the 1300 movies I analyzed only 12 of them were directed by women of color. There were only 10 individuals who directed 
        the films.

          The treemap below shows the number of male, female, and women of color directors that have 
          directed a top 100 film with a major distrubutor (Universal, Disney etc.) in the last 13 years. The tooltip gives the exact number 
          of movies directed by a person in each catergory. WoC stand for woman of color.
